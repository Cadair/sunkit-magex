Reporting Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use pfsspy and stumble upon a problem, the best way to report it is by
opening an `issue`_ on the GitHub issue tracker.
This way we can help you work around the problem and hopefully fix the problem!

When reporting an issue, please try to provide a short description of the issue
with a small code sample, this way we can attempt to reproduce the error.
Also provide any error output generated when you encountered the issue, we can
use this information to debug the issue.

Requesting new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is functionality that is not currently available in pfsspy you can
make a feature request. Please add as much information as possible regarding
the new feature you would like to see.
